		In this project I will enable a toy car to learn to perform stunts such as drifting and parallel parking by itself through machine learning. I will walk you through the progesss of my project right from modifying an RC car to implementing the machine learning algorithms. I'll be using custom from-scratch designs so that if you are interested, you can also make your own stunt car and even improve upon my design.
		My inspiration came from <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opsmd5yuBF0" target = "_blank"> MIT's autonomous drifting using machine learning</a>.
